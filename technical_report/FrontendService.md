# Frontend service

The Front-End part of CRYK app will consist of an Angular application that makes requests to an API Gateway in order to retreive/send data.

The app design will consist of three main components:

## Dashboard Page

The Dashboard is the main part of the application. Here, the user will see a list of the most popular cryptocurrencies, along with their respective price and a small graph. The user can also see the price of the cryptocurrency in different currencies, and the price change in real-time. 

## Cryptocurrency Details

The user can click on a cryptocurrency to see more details about it. The details page will show the price of the cryptocurrency in different currencies, the price change in real-time, and a graph with the price history of the cryptocurrency. 

## Cryptocurrency Chart

The user can click on a cryptocurrency to see a graph with the price history of the cryptocurrency. Here, the chart can be filtered by time, can be zoomed-in and out, and can be changed into different types of graphs (can be a line chart, a candlestick chart, etc).
Also, the user can addnotate the chart.
