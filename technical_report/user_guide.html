                <h2>Abstract - What is CryK</h2>
                This report serves as a user-guide for the Cryptocurrency Knowledge Manager Web Application,
                showcasing three use-cases of the service.
                The purpose of the application is to provide users with a platform where they can learn about
                cryptocurrencies, as well as to provide them with a platform where they can follow their favorite
                cryptocurrencies and view the real-time price of their favorite cryptocurrencies as well as others.
            </section>

                <h2>Startup</h2>
                When accessing the web application for the first time, you land on the Dashboard Page. This page
                contains a list of the most popular cryptocurrencies, each with its price in USDT, as well as the price in BTC.
                The Dashboard Page is the default page for the application.

            <section>
                <h2>Dashboard Page</h2>
                Besides showing the most popular cryptocurrencies, each item in the list is expandable, and when expanded,
                it shows a chart with the price of the cryptocurrency filtered by 30 minutes, as well as a short description
                of the cryptocurrency. The chart is interactive, and you can zoom in and out of the chart, as well as move
                the chart to the left and right. All the prices on this page are real-time prices, and they are updated every
                3 seconds.

            <section>
                <h2>Browse Page</h2>
                The Browse Page is the page where you can find all the cryptocurrencies available on the application. You can
                search for a cryptocurrency by name, or by symbol. The search is case-insensitive, and it is done in real-time.
                The search results are shown in a suggestion box below the search bar. The search results are clickable, and
                when clicked, they redirect you to the cryptocurrency's page. The list is also filtered by the search results,
                so you can see only the cryptocurrencies that match your search. The list is also paginated, and you can
                navigate through the pages using the pagination buttons at the bottom of the list as well as change the
                number of items per page.

            <section>
                <h2>Details Page</h2>
                The Details Page is the page where you can find all the details about a cryptocurrency. You can access this page
                by clicking on a cryptocurrency from the Browse Page, or by clicking on a cryptocurrency from the Dashboard Page.
                The Details Page contains a chart with the price of the cryptocurrency, as well as a short description of the cryptocurrency. 
                The chart is interactive, and you can zoom in and out of the chart, as well as
                move the chart to the left and right. All the prices on this page are real-time prices, and they are updated every
                3 seconds.
                Under the chart, there are four cards with some quick facts, the first one being the most interesting because it shows
                the current live  price of the cryptocurrency.

                <h2>Chart</h2>
                The chart is the main feature of the Details Page. It shows the price of the cryptocurrency in USDT and it is
                interactive. You can zoom in and out of the chart, as well as move the chart to the left and right.
                There are also buttons on the chart that allow you to change the time period of the chart. The buttons are:
                <ul>
                    <li>1m - 1 minute</li>
                    <li>3m - 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>5m - 5 minutes</li>

                    </figure>
                    The chart is also available in two different modes: Area and Candlestick. You can switch between the two modes by
                    clicking on the "Area" button. The Area mode shows the price of the cryptocurrency in a line chart, while the
                    Candlestick mode shows the price of the cryptocurrency in a candlestick chart.

                <h2>Live Price</h2>
                The Live Price is a feature that allows you to see the real-time price of a cryptocurrency. This feature is available
                on the Details Page. The Live Price is a card that shows the current price of the cryptocurrency in USDT by default, 
                but you can change the currency by selecting a different cryptocurrency on the "Choose a currency" button. 
                The price is updated every 3 seconds. Next to the price and symbol of the exchange rate is an arrow that shows
                if the price is going up or down. If the price is going up, the arrow is green, and if the price is going down, the
                arrow is red.

            <section>
                <h2>Info about the cryptocurrency</h2>
                The Details Page also contains a card with some information about the cryptocurrency. This card contains some useful information about the cryptocurrency, such as the
                name, the symbol, the block reward, and more. What stands apart is that if you hover over any of the information, a tooltip appears with a short description of the information.
                This is extremely useful because it allows you to learn more about the cryptocurrency without having to leave the page.
