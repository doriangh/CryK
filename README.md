# CryK - Cryptocurrency Knowledge Manager

Starting with [Description Of A CryptoCurrency](https://doacc.github.io/), develop a modular Web system capable to express and manage the knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and their (meta-)data. Each functionality will be implemented by a (micro-)service and all queries will be performed via a SPARQL endpoint. Exposed information will be available in multiple formats (at least, HTML+RDFa and JSON-LD). Also, multiple [visualizations of interest](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/hci-film.html#week11) will be provided. For additional resources, explore [CryptoMinded](https://cryptominded.com/).
